      <h1>An Explanation of the Data</h1>
      <p>
        The information on this website was sourced from the CORGIS Airline Dataset, which can be found <a href="https://think.cs.vt.edu/corgis/json/airlines/airlines.html">here</a>.
        The data contains information about the flights out of every major airport in the U.S.A. on every carrier between 2003 and 2016, including points on the number of flights,
        as well as the duration, frequency, type, and length of delays.<br><br>
        Data is reported for the following airlines:<br>
        <ul>
          {% for airline in airlines %}
            <li>{{airline}}</li>
          {% endfor %}
        </ul><br>
        It should be noted that the following mergers have occurred throughout the range of the dataset, after which the named airlines reported as one:<br>
        <ul>
          <li>US Airways & America West >>> US Airways [2006]</li>
          <li>Delta & Northwest >>> Delta [2010]</li>
          <li>United & Continental >>> United [2012]</li>
          <li>Atlantic Southeast & ExpressJet >>> ExpressJet [2012]</li>
          <li>Pinnacle >>> Endeavor [2013]</li>
          <li>American Eagle >>> Envoy [2014]</li>
          <li>Southwest & AirTran >>> Southwest [2015]</li>

        </ul><br>
